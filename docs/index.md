# About Me

I got my start at 16 by working at a local computer repair shop supporting Windows and Linux PC's and Laptops.  I ran my first web server out of our house using a dial-up connection. 

In 2009, I got my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from TAMUCC. While there, I grew my understanding of the foundations of Computer Science. After college I was hired at ExxonMobil to work with their Upstream Research Company on scientific software. This is where my simplification of complexity truly began. In 2015, I began working as a UX Design Lead, first on my own as the program was getting started and then later as a team leader for a group of designers that I helped to hire.
