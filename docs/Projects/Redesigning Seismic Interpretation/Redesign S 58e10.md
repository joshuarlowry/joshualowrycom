# Redesign Seismic Interpretation Product

I redesigned a scientific software product to make Seismic Interpreters **100x faster.** I used lean research methods, sketching across whiteboards and paper, and utilized PowerPoint and Illustrator to get this job done. The redesign **reduced training by 10x** and **increased the user base by 10x**. The product was used to secure key assets in Guyana. 

# Situation

When I was assigned, there was a team lead, three developers, and three scientists working on a functional prototype. The scientists who invented the technology were spending a week of one on one time to train people to use the tool by walking them through real-world problems. Unfortunately, this did not result in new users. 

# Approach

I had a prior relationship at ExxonMobil with the lead developer as well as the team lead. This was helpful because it enabled us to quickly build rapport together for the research. I started by reading up on the science, getting a walkthrough on the product, and having conversations about challenges that the team has already seen.

After some research, we reduced the complexity of the original workflow (spanning pages of materials) down to three simple steps. Additionally, we began building some proto-personas. This became important later when the organization accelerated the timeline. We decided together that our largest benefits were with Lance, not Danielle.

On the flip side, there are potentially dozens of Lance who can take the output and identify the value.](Redesign%20S%2058e10/sketchingtechniquesforcreatingheadroom-170917183106-12.png)

Danielle is adept at seismic processing and there is only a handful of Danielle who truly understands how to make the processing tools really sing. On the flip side, there are potentially dozens of Lance who can take the output and identify the value.

Because the entire tool was made for Danielle we were paying a premium for developing this software and losing the benefits. Danielle was successful with scripts prior to the decision to commercialize. 

# Concepts

![The original prototype had areas we knew were for Danielle who invented the tech and ultimately commissioned this prototype. We used progressive disclosure to de-emphasize some of the elements away from the main flow.](Redesign%20S%2058e10/sketchingtechniquesforcreatingheadroom-170917183106-13.png)

![Without the technology, geoscientists searched for a needle in a haystack and the original design tried to turn that into a list. The team viewed this list as a table that people would filter and sort, but that was hard to do in a non-visual way.](Redesign%20S%2058e10/sketchingtechniquesforcreatingheadroom-170917183106-11.png)

## Seismic amplitude filters

![We knew that geoscientists think visually, but we never thought it could be extended from the earth's crust to seismic amplitudes.](Redesign%20S%2058e10/sketchingtechniquesforcreatingheadroom-170917183106-21.png)

## Layer-based filters

![Our initial testing revealed some confusion in the language for the original interface for layer-based filters. Above, does that mean we keep what is above or remove what is above?](Redesign%20S%2058e10/sketchingtechniquesforcreatingheadroom-170917183106-23.png)

![We reused the elements from seismic amplitude filtering to layer-based filtering. We ruled out the need for an “outside filter” as it was more generally understood as removing the top (typically an ocean floor) than some other filter. The two are not typically linked together. Where as the “between” filter is typically two layers around an area of interest.](Redesign%20S%2058e10/sketchingtechniquesforcreatingheadroom-170917183106-25.png)

## Deeper relationships

While not pictured explicitly below, we determined that some relationships are better seen visually than numerically. I can speak to how we uncovered some of these relationships and how our interaction design works, but they don’t exist outside of the ExxonMobil network.

# Testing and analytics

During my design work, I informally tested designs on actual paper to evaluate assumptions and sat with the dev team to make those designs a reality. 

![Where we had gaps we sketched on the fly and found solutions together. ](Redesign%20S%2058e10/sketchingtechniquesforcreatingheadroom-170917183106-39.png)

Where we had gaps we sketched on the fly and found solutions together. 

We instrumented the software with a few key checkpoints to verify how people were using it. With this data, we confirmed the 10x increase in adoption within the first year.

# Further discussion

There are a few topics we could discuss further.

- How did I manage the delicate relationships when coming in to redesign a product while the parents were still working on and using the product?
- What was the role of subject matter experts and how did I leverage their knowledge and expertise to accelerate our design process?
- What are some of the tools you used to get this design work done?
