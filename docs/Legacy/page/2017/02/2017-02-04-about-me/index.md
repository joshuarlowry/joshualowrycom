# Bio

I have had many jobs throughout my career, most of which lead me to choose a degree in computer science and work with my mind instead of my hands. While at Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, I worked on various department websites to improve Section 508 compliance, tutored students, and graded for multiple classes.

I started working at ExxonMobil in 2009 as a unicorn Developer/Designer. I was promoted to a newly created position, User Experience Lead, in 2015. My efforts now are dedicated to making great products and drive organizational adoption of UX Design principles.

# Side-gigs

Outside of work I have lead several major efforts.

In 2010, I served as the ExxonMobil Cycling Team Safety Lead. This role is to ensure the safety of all our riders throughout the training season and during the MS150 (Houston to Austin). We were awarded the Gold Safety Award.

From 2011 through 2014, I served as the ExxonMobil Cycling Team Captain. This role included a seat on the Houston ExxonMobil Club Board. I personally oversaw the efforts of our leadership team to ensure that 200-300 cyclists are prepared to complete our flagship charity ride from Houston to Austin every year (MS150). We were awarded the Platinum Safety Award in 2012 and 2013. Together, we raised $1.2 Million for the National MS Society. One of my biggest accomplishments during this time was creating a succession plan for the team's leadership.

After retiring from the Team Captain role I moved on to lead the Energy Riders Training Series. I worked with the leadership from each of the partner teams (14 teams totaling 1000 riders) to organize and conduct training rides geared towards preparing for the MS150. I designed a web tool for estimating training ride consumables based on expected attendance (food, water, etc.). In addition, I designed the information architecture for the training series website and created most of the content.
