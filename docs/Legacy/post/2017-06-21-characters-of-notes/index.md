description: I figured it is about time to reveal some of the characters of my notes. Over time I have been trying to draw, with a short amount of time, characters in my notes. Typically this is someone who has said something interesting in a meeting or the person delivering a presentation. Shout out if you see yourself. I also sometimes draw characters when I need to get my creative juices flowing, so some of these are characters that don't relate to anyone in particular.

# Characters of Notes
I figured it is about time to reveal some of the characters of my notes. Over time I have been trying to draw, with a short amount of time, characters in my notes. Typically this is someone who has said something interesting in a meeting or the person delivering a presentation. Shout out if you see yourself. I also sometimes draw characters when I need to get my creative juices flowing, so some of these are characters that don't relate to anyone in particular.

For all of these sketches, I used either a ball-point pen or my Sharpie Pen.
