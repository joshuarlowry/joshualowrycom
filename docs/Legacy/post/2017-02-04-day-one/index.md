# Day One
Hello and welcome,

Today, February 4, 2017,Â I rebooted my plans to share my ideas more publicly on the internet. Flicking the switch for this site was one of the first steps.

I will post here regularly every Wednesday starting in March.

The following topics are in scope:

1. Miscellaneous Sketches
2. Thoughts on Design
3. Thoughts on Design-related Articles
4. Unsolicited Redesigns
5. Maybe more...

You can find out when posts go out by following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joshthejest) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshualowry/).

Opinions posted on this site are my own and not the views of my employer.
