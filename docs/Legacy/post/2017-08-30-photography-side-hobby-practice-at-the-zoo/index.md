A few posts ago I mentioned renting camera equipment. It was finally time to pick up and use the equipment in advance of vacation (where the real use begins).

Off to the [Houston Zoo](https://www.houstonzoo.org/)! All of the photos are high-res, so please open them up and get a look at the details. These photos are mine, please don't use them without talking to me first. My wife and I both took photos at the zoo, but these are my top pics from the pictures I took.

I took these pictures with a Nikon D7500. To start, I used a Nikon 18-300mm lens. Later, I switched to an enormous 200-500mm lens. For those who like to geek out.

Here are my basic warm-ups with the lemurs. There are a few here that aren't quite as in-focus as I would have liked, but such is life when you are warming up.

Next, we stopped to take a few photos of this vibrant orangutan. Unfortunately, this guy was sitting right in front of a strap.

Following this, we saw a beautiful tiger taking a drink at the stream in his enclosure.

A short walk away we found one of the gorillas doing some morning stretches. This particular activity makes me wonder if we humans are doing something wrong with our morning routines. Maybe I should stay laying in bed and do some stretching before engaging in activities.

At this point, I decided to switch to the 200-500mm lens, because the chimpanzees were so far off in the distance.

Finally, I leave you with this incredibly detailed photo of an Emu. This emu seemed intrigued with something in my general direction. I took this photo between two cables in the enclosure.
