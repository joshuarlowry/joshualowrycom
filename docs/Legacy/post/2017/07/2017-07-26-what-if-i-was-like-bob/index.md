I was out on the [Sketch Daily Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/) again looking for sketch prompts. This time, it was a Cartoon Self Portrait in the style of your favorite cartoon. I'm a big fan of [Bob's Burgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob%27s_Burgers), and I bear some resemblance to Bob I think.

First, I took a look at some pictures of both myself and Bob. Here is what I used for inspiration.

# Version One

I quickly started sketching. I started with Bob and then started sketching myself. Then, I added some annotations to critique my sketches. I decided to draw both of us together as though we were in the cartoon.

I wanted to make sure to carry this through to the final sketch. I realized after sketching Bob that we actually are both quite hairy. I wanted to show that similarity in the sketch as well. For my own portrait, I felt like my hair wasn't swoopy enough, and It felt like I was facing the wrong direction for the overall sketch.\[/caption\]

 

# Version Two

\[caption id="attachment\_1756" align="aligncenter" width="273"\]![Self Portrait Bob's Burgers_2](https://joshualowrycom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/self-portrait-bobs-burgers_2.jpg?w=273) One of the big things from this sketch was that my head shape and size of my neck seemed wrong. Also, Bob's head felt wrong, the eyes were too small, the mouth area was too wide, and his hair part didn't line up correctly. Also, I decided I wanted to wear a shirt with something interesting on it. I thought a cool rocket ship logo thing would be good, but I just can't draw that correctly.\[/caption\]

 

# Version Three

\[caption id="attachment\_1758" align="aligncenter" width="285"\]![Self Portrait Bob's Burgers_3](https://joshualowrycom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/self-portrait-bobs-burgers_3.jpg?w=285) It does look like I'm a little creeper behind Bob, but overall I think this sketch looks good. I'm similarly hairy, our parts look fabulous, and I'm ready to pop into Bob's Burgers and eat me one of them "If Looks Could Kale" burgers.\[/caption\]
