Sometimes the best user experiences aren't that you went through and did a ton of research to re-architect the entire experience, but that you thought about what could be valuable and made something just a bit better.

A recent example I have in mind is the coffee shop I frequent. It is similar to most coffee shops in that they can make fancy drinks or just allow you to self-serve coffee.

When I self-serve coffee I prefer this place because they put the hot coffee sleeves on the cups for you!

> 1 small cup of coffee, please.

1. Pay
2. Fill
3. Cream
4. Stir
5. Lid
6. Done
