Sometimes good designs can become great designs by rearranging the parts. I find that the best arrangement for tasks closely mirrors the way we do things without technology. The closer we match these experiences the easier our system will be to use. As a bonus, rearranging interfaces is typically pretty simple and low cost.

Take the Nintendo Switch eShop experience for example. In theory, buying a game from the eShop should be similar to that of brick and mortar stores. The journey looks something like the following.

It doesn't matter what you are buying, it follows this basic workflow.

Nintendo's eStore experience is very different. It includes essential additional steps, but they are out of order.

How can we reorder these steps to make the experience better and make it easier to get into the store to peruse new releases?

Today, we have the following process.

1. Enter the Store
2. Halt Who Goes There!
3. What's the Password!?
4. Find the Item
5. Buy It

It seems unnecessary to have someone log-in to the store before they have decided to make a purchase.

- Enter the Store
- Halt Who Goes There!
- Find the Item
- Buy It
- What's the Password!?

As a bonus action, we can remove the "Halt Who Goes There!" step of this process and move it to earlier in the Nintendo Switch experience. This step is required any time you launch an app (including the eShop) from the home screen. Maybe that step should actually be changed to when you wake up the Switch and change users explicitly thus reducing the burden for this workflow.

- Enter the Store
- Find the Item
- Buy It
- What's the Password!?

In closing, I hope you see how you might be able to evaluate and improve the experience of a workflow by re-thinking the flow between components.
