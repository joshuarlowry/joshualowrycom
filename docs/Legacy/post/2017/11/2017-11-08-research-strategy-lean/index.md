Lean UX to me is a method for prioritizing evaluative research over generative research. In the long run, you will have the same research information, but the product will have been delivered dozens of times to the customer already. It sounds like a great win on the surface, but it requires a large commitment on the part of the entire team.

The product owner (hopefully only one real person) needs to prioritize vertically to ensure full features are delivered.

Your dev-ops stable team (assuming this exists) is strong and has a knack and drive to automate deployments directly to your customer.

Management understands that failure is learning. This new information can change the entire product direction, timeline, effort, and success!

Your designers are OK with experimental designs that aren't tested or vetted. Sketchers welcome!
